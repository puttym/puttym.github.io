A positive integer $$a$$ can be expressed as a power of another positive
integer $$b$$, if

$$
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
log_{b} a = \frac{\ln a}{\ln b} = \text{An integer}}.
\end{equation}
$$

For example, since,

$$
\begin{equation}
\log_{8} 4098 = \frac{\ln 4098}{\ln 8} = 4.0002
\end{equation}
$$

is not an integer, 4098 can not be expressed as a power of 8. However,
4096 can be expressed as a power of 8 as

$$
\begin{equation}
\log_{8} 4096 = \frac{\ln 4096}{\ln 8} = 4.
\end{equation}
$$

There is one more way to check if a given number can be expressed as power
of another number.

A positive integer $$a$$ can be expressed as the power of another positive
integer $$b$$, if,
  1. $$a$$ is devisible by $$b$$ and
  2. $$\frac{a}{b}$$ is a power of $$b$$.

These conditions appear to be very simple, but the calculations get really
messy because the conditions have to be applied recursievely. This method is
best suited for a computer program. Lagarthmic method is best suited for quick
calculations.
