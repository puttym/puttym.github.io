Hi, thanks for visiting my blog!

I am Madhukara Putty. My formal backgrounds are in physics and computational 
fluid dynamics.

I am convinced that having the ability to develop quality software is an
important skill in any area of knowledge today. Therefore, since late 2019,
I am making conscious attempts to improve my programming skills. One day,
I hope to be good enough to contribute to opensource scientific software.

Most recently, I was part of a space tech start up located in Bengaluru,
India. Before that, I was a freelance science journalist who wrote
popular science articles based on research papers published in top
science journals. Please visit my [Contently](https://madhukaraputty.contently.com) 
page for a list of articles I wrote as a freelancer.

Before my freelance gig, I was part of the awesome team that ran the Science Media
Centre at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. I was responsible for
content related to physics, math, and engineering, while our Chief Editor,
Sandhya Sekhar, looked after the biological sciences. We built a fantastic team
of writers who wrote about 300 articles in the first year of operation.
It was great fun, but at some point, some of us decided to move on and pursue
our other interests.

That's my story so far! I hope you enjoy my blog :)
