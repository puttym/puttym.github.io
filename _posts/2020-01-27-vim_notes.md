*This is just a dump of vim tricks that I have found useful. They are
taken from multiple sources.*

+ **Move the screen**
  1. `Ctrl`+`e` - Move the screen up. Cursor doesn't move
  2. `Ctrl`+`y` - Move the screen down. Cursor doesn't move
  3. `Ctrl`+`u` - Move cursor and screen up 1/2 page
  4. `Ctrl`+`d` - Move cursor and screen down 1/2 page 
  3. `zt` - Move the current line to the top of the screen
  4. `zb` - Move the current line to the bottom of the screen

+ **Open recent files**
  1. Hit `Ctrl-o-o`. Keep hitting it until you get the file you want
  2. `:browse oldfiles` `Esc` `File number` `Enter`
  3. `:browse oldfiles` gives a list of last 100 files you have opened in vim

+ **Code Indentation**
  1. `V}>` - `V}` selects a block (paragraph) and `>` applies indentation

+ **Reformat text**
  1. Select the text
  2. Press `gq`

+ **Disable search highlighting temporarily**
  1. `:nohlsearch` or simply `:noh`
  2. Press `n`/`N` to continue previous search

+ **Comment out multiple lines**
  1. For entire file: `:%s/^/#/g`
  2. For a particular range, say from line 10 to 20: `:10,20s/^/#`
  3. To uncomment: `:%s/^#//g`

+ **Deleting lines**
  1. `S` - Delete the entire line and switch to insert mode
  2. `C` - Delete the rest of the line and switch to insert mode
  3. `dd` - Delete the entire line, and stay in normal mode

+ **Deleting words**
  1. `dw` - Delete rest of the word including the space after that. Stay in
     normal mode after the operation
  2. `cw` - Delete rest of the word excluding the space after that. Switch to
     normal mode after the operation

+ **Switch case**
  1. `~` - Change the case of current character
  2. `gUw` - Change the rest of the word to uppercase
  3. `guw` - Change the rest of the word to lowercase
  4. `gUU` - Change the current line to uppercase
  5. `guu` - Change the current line to lowercase


+ **Redo**
  1. `Ctrl` `R` to redo the last action
  2. `4` `Ctrl` `R` to redo the last 4 actions (I haven't tried this)
