## Around 1599

* **Important Dates**

	- 28 August, 1608: *Hector* becomes the first EIC vessel to drop anchor
	in India
	- 1618: The EIC gets permission from Jahangir to build their first
	factory in Surat
	- Around 1618: Second factory established at Masulipatnam on the east
	coast - the port of the Mughal's Deccani rivals. This was for textiles
	- Around 1618: Third factory comes up in Patna trading in Saltpetre - an
	active ingredient in gun powder.
	- 1634: EIC gets permission to build a fort near Madraspatnam. This becomes
	the first colonial town in India.  
  <br>
* **Incentives given to the East India Company (EIC):**
	- Exemption from all custom duties for their first six voyages
	- A British monopoly for 15 years over 'trade to the East Indies', an
	area that was not clearly defined
	- Semi-sovereign privilages to rule territories and raise armies
  
  <br> In essense, the EIC, a private company, was granted permission to:
	- Claim jurisdiction over all English subjects in Asia
	- Mint money
	- Raise fortifications
	- Make laws
	- Wage war
	- Conduct an independent foreign policy
	- Hold courts
	- Issue punishment
	- Imprison English subjects
	- Plant English settlements.

  <br>
* **Status of England in early 1600s**
	- A relatively impoverished, largely agricultural country.
	- Spain and Portugal were already successful in planting and sustaining
	viable colonies in different continents. They were, naturally, the economic
	powerhouses of Europe. The Dutch were growing fast
	- The English were forced to look for new markets and commercial openings.
	 In skills of long-distance trade or planting and sustaining viable colonies,
	the English were rookies in comparison to their European neighbors.
	- They started off by looting Spanish, Portugese, and Dutch ships 
	laden with rich cargo.  

  <br>
* **Investments, as in 1602 (not in today's GBP value):**
	- The English EIC: GBP 68,373
	- The Dutch EIC: GBP 550,000.   

  <br>
* **India in early 1600s:**
	- Population: 150 million (about a fifth of global population). England,
	at that time, had 5% of India's population.
	- Was the world's industrial power house - was producing about a 
	quarter of global manufacturing. England was accounted for a little
	less than 3%.
	- World's leader in manufactured textiles
	- Was certainly responsible for a much larger share of world trade than
	any comparable zone
	- It's economic power even reached Mexico, whose textile manufacture
	suffered a crisis of 'de-industrialization' due to Indian cloth imports
	- The Moghul emperor in India was the richest monarch in the world.
	He had an income of around GBP 100 million (> GBP 10 billion today). 
	- The Mughal capitals were the megacities of their day. They attracted
	merchants from all over Asia.
	- Between 1586 and 1605, the Mughals imported 18 metric tons of European 
	silver every year.
	- The Mughals had an army of 4 million men. No European nation could
	think of a war with the Mughals.
	- Both the Portugese and the English tried to establish a relationship
	with the Mughal Empereror by giving him expensive gifts. The Portugese
	were more excitable than the English, and they paid the price for that.
	- The Mughals were curious about the English, but hardly overwhelmed. 
	Infact, they regarded relations with the English as a very low priority.<br>

* **Reversal of spice trade**
	- By 1630s, EIC was importing GBP 1 million worth of pepper from India, and began
  	exporting it to Italy and the Middle East. 
	- This was a landmark development because, for centuries, spice trade 
	was dominated by Middle Eastern middlemen who trebled the price as their commission.

  <br>
* **The birth of Madras**
	- In 1634, the EIC got the permission to build a fort near a fishing village 
	called **Madraspatnam**. 
	- This village was chosen because the concerned EIC official
	had an affair with a woman who lived close Madraspatnam.

  <br> The EIC got the right 
	- to build a fort and castle
	- to trade customs free
	- to perpetually enjoy the privilages of mintage

  <br>By 1670s, the town Madras had grown to be the first colonial town in India. It
  was also minting its own **gold coins**.
